Tests for Voxel Telephone

## Running
1. `pnpm` is used and should be installed.
2. Run `pnpm i` to install dependencies.
3. For first setup, run `pnpm run clone` to clone the `BunnyNabbit/voxel-telephone` repository.
4. Run tests by using `pnpm run test`. This will also keep the `BunnyNabbit/voxel-telephone` repository up to date.
